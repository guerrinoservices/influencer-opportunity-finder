   - Reads visible text and elements from the page you're viewing
   - Identifies relevant information (e.g., product identifiers, status indicators)

   - **No page content or product data is sent to external servers** (except license validation)

✅ No page content or product data is transmitted to our servers

✅ When you download results, the CSV file is created on your device

**Data Flow:**
```
Web Page → Extension (Your Browser) → Results (Your Device)
         ↓
    [External Server: License validation only]
```
